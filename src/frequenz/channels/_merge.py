"""Merge messages coming from multiple receivers into a single receiver.

# Usage

If you just need to receive the same type of messages but from multiple sources in one
stream, you can use [`merge()`][frequenz.channels.merge] to create a new receiver that
will receive messages from all the given receivers:

```python show_lines="8:"
from frequenz.channels import Anycast, Receiver, merge

channel1: Anycast[int] = Anycast(name="channel1")
channel2: Anycast[int] = Anycast(name="channel2")
receiver1 = channel1.new_receiver()
receiver2 = channel2.new_receiver()

async for message in merge(receiver1, receiver2):
    print(message)
```

If the first message comes from `channel2` and the second message from `channel1`, the
first message will be received immediately, and the second message will be received as
soon as it is available.

This can be helpful when you just need to receive messages and don't care about
where are they coming from specifically. If you need to know where the message came
from, you can use [`select()`][frequenz.channels.select] instead.

# Stopping

A merge receiver will be stopped automatically when all the receivers that it merges are
stopped. When using the async iterator interface, this means that the iterator will stop
as soon as all the receivers are stopped. When using
[`receive()`][frequenz.channels.Receiver.receive], this means that the method will raise
a [`ReceiverStoppedError`][frequenz.channels.ReceiverStoppedError] exception as soon as
all the receivers are stopped.

If you want to stop a merge receiver manually, you can use the
[`stop()`][frequenz.channels.Merger.stop] method.

When using [`receive()`][frequenz.channels.Receiver.receive], you should make sure to
either stop all the receivers that you are merging, or to stop the merge receiver
manually. This is to make sure that all the tasks created by the merge receiver are
cleaned up properly.
