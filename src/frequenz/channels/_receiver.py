"""Receiver interface and related exceptions.

# Receivers

Messages are received from [channels](/user-guide/channels/index.md) through
[`Receiver`][] objects. [`Receiver`][]s
are usually created by calling `channel.new_receiver()` and are [async
iterators][typing.AsyncIterator], so the easiest way to receive messages from them as
a stream is to use `async for`:

```python show_lines="6:"
from frequenz.channels import Anycast

channel = Anycast[int](name="test-channel")
receiver = channel.new_receiver()

async for message in receiver:
    print(message)
```

If you need to receive messages in different places or expecting a particular
sequence, you can use the [`receive()`][] method:

```python show_lines="6:"
from frequenz.channels import Anycast

channel = Anycast[int](name="test-channel")
receiver = channel.new_receiver()

first_message = await receiver.receive()
print(f"First message: {first_message}")

second_message = await receiver.receive()
print(f"Second message: {second_message}")
```

# Message Transformation

If you need to transform the received messages, receivers provide a
[`map()`][] method to easily do so:

```python show_lines="6:"
from frequenz.channels import Anycast

channel = Anycast[int](name="test-channel")
receiver = channel.new_receiver()

async for message in receiver.map(lambda x: x + 1):
    print(message)
```

[`map()`][] returns a new full receiver, so you can
use it in any of the ways described above.

# Message Filtering

If you need to filter the received messages, receivers provide a
[`filter()`][] method to easily do so:

```python show_lines="6:"
from frequenz.channels import Anycast

channel = Anycast[int](name="test-channel")
receiver = channel.new_receiver()

async for message in receiver.filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0):
    print(message)  # Only even numbers will be printed
```

As with [`map()`][],
[`filter()`][] returns a new full receiver, so you can
use it in any of the ways described above.

# Error Handling

!!! Tip inline end

    For more information about handling errors, please refer to the
    [Error Handling](/user-guide/error-handling/) section of the user guide.

If there is an error while receiving a message,
a [`ReceiverError`][] exception is raised for both
[`receive()`][] method and async iteration
interface.

If the receiver has completely stopped (for example the underlying channel was
closed), a [`ReceiverStoppedError`][] exception
is raised by [`receive()`][] method.

```python show_lines="6:"
from frequenz.channels import Anycast

channel = Anycast[int](name="test-channel")
receiver = channel.new_receiver()

try:
    await receiver.receive()
except ReceiverStoppedError as error:
    print("The receiver was stopped")
except ReceiverError as error:
    print(f"There was an error trying to receive: {error}")
```

When used as an async iterator, the iteration will just stop without raising an
exception:

```python show_lines="6:"
from frequenz.channels import Anycast

channel = Anycast[int](name="test-channel")
receiver = channel.new_receiver()

try:
    async for message in receiver:
        print(message)
except ReceiverStoppedError as error:
    print("Will never happen")
except ReceiverError as error:
    print(f"There was an error trying to receive: {error}")
# If we get here, the receiver was stopped
```

# Closing receivers

When a particular stream of data is no-longer required, it is a good practice to close
the receiver to free up resources. This is especially important in applications that are
repeatedly creating new receivers.  The
[`Receiver.close()`][] method can be used for this
purpose.

After [`Receiver.close()`][] is called, we can still receive messages that are in the receiver's
buffer, but as soon as the receiver's buffer has been drained, trying to receive further
messages from a *closed* receiver will raise a
[`ReceiverStoppedError`][].

# Advanced Usage

!!! Warning inline end

    This section is intended for library developers that want to build other low-level
    abstractions on top of channels. If you are just using channels, you can safely
    ignore this section.

Receivers extend on the [async iterator protocol][typing.AsyncIterator] by providing
a [`ready()`][] and
a [`consume()`][] method.

The [`ready()`][] method is used to await until the
receiver has a new message available, but without actually consuming it. The
[`consume()`][] method consumes the next available
message and returns it.

[`ready()`][] can be called multiple times, and it
will return immediately if the receiver is already ready.
[`consume()`][] must be called only after
[`ready()`][] is done and only once, until the next
call to [`ready()`][].

Exceptions are never raised by [`ready()`][], they
are always delayed until [`consume()`][] is
called.
