    # Description

    !!! Tip inline end

        [Anycast][frequenz.channels.Anycast] channels behave like the
        [Golang](https://golang.org/) [channels](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Channel_types).

    [Anycast][frequenz.channels.Anycast] channels support multiple
    [senders][frequenz.channels.Sender] and multiple
    [receivers][frequenz.channels.Receiver]. Each message sent through any of the
    senders will be received by exactly one receiver (but **any** receiver).

    <center>
    ```bob
    .---------. msg1                           msg1  .-----------.
    | Sender  +------.                       .------>| Receiver  |
    '---------'      |      .----------.     |       '-----------'
                     +----->| Channel  +-----+
    .---------.      |      '----------'     |       .-----------.
    | Sender  +------'                       '------>| Receiver  |
    '---------' msg2                           msg2  '-----------'
    ```
    </center>

    !!! Note inline end "Characteristics"

        * **Buffered:** Yes, with a global channel buffer
        * **Buffer full policy:** Block senders
        * **Multiple receivers:** Yes
        * **Multiple senders:** Yes
        * **Thread-safe:** No

    This channel is buffered, and if the senders are faster than the receivers, then the
    channel's buffer will fill up. In that case, the senders will block at the
    [`send()`][frequenz.channels.Sender.send] method until the receivers consume the
    messages in the channel's buffer. The channel's buffer size can be configured at
    creation time via the `limit` argument.

    The first receiver that is awaited will get the next message. When multiple
    receivers are waiting, the [asyncio][] loop scheduler picks a receiver for each next
    massage.

    This means that, in practice, there might be only one receiver receiving all the
    messages, depending on how tasks are schduled.

    If you need to ensure some delivery policy (like round-robin or uniformly random),
    then you will have to implement it yourself.

    To create a new [senders][frequenz.channels.Sender] and
    [receivers][frequenz.channels.Receiver] you can use the
    [`new_sender()`][frequenz.channels.Broadcast.new_sender] and
    [`new_receiver()`][frequenz.channels.Broadcast.new_receiver] methods
    respectively.

    When the channel is not needed anymore, it should be closed with the
    [`close()`][frequenz.channels.Anycast.close] method. This will prevent further
    attempts to [`send()`][frequenz.channels.Sender.send] data. Receivers will still be
    able to drain the pending messages on the channel, but after that, subsequent
    [`receive()`][frequenz.channels.Receiver.receive] calls will raise a
    [`ReceiverStoppedError`][frequenz.channels.ReceiverStoppedError] exception.

    This channel is useful, for example, to distribute work across multiple workers.

    In cases where each message need to be received by every receiver, a
    [broadcast][frequenz.channels.Broadcast] channel may be used.

    # Examples

    Example: Send a few numbers to a receiver
        This is a very simple example that sends a few numbers from a single sender to
        a single receiver.

        ```python
        import asyncio

        from frequenz.channels import Anycast, Sender


        async def send(sender: Sender[int]) -> None:
            for message in range(3):
                print(f"sending {message}")
                await sender.send(message)


        async def main() -> None:
            channel = Anycast[int](name="numbers")

            sender = channel.new_sender()
            receiver = channel.new_receiver()

            async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as task_group:
                task_group.create_task(send(sender))
                for _ in range(3):
                    message = await receiver.receive()
                    print(f"received {message}")
                    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # sleep (or work) with the data


        asyncio.run(main())
        ```

        The output should look something like (although the sending and received might
        appear more interleaved):

        ```
        sending 0
        sending 1
        sending 2
        received 0
        received 1
        received 2
        ```

    Example: Send a few number from multiple senders to multiple receivers
        This is a more complex example that sends a few numbers from multiple senders to
        multiple receivers, using a small buffer to force the senders to block.

        ```python
        import asyncio

        from frequenz.channels import Anycast, Receiver, ReceiverStoppedError, Sender


        async def send(name: str, sender: Sender[int], start: int, stop: int) -> None:
            for message in range(start, stop):
                print(f"{name} sending {message}")
                await sender.send(message)


        async def recv(name: str, receiver: Receiver[int]) -> None:
            try:
                async for message in receiver:
                    print(f"{name} received {message}")
                await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # sleep (or work) with the data
            except ReceiverStoppedError:
                pass


        async def main() -> None:
            acast = Anycast[int](name="numbers", limit=2)

            async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as task_group:
                task_group.create_task(send("sender_1", acast.new_sender(), 10, 13))
                task_group.create_task(send("sender_2", acast.new_sender(), 20, 22))
                task_group.create_task(recv("receiver_1", acast.new_receiver()))
                task_group.create_task(recv("receiver_2", acast.new_receiver()))


        asyncio.run(main())
        ```

        The output should look something like this(although the sending and received
        might appear interleaved in a different way):

        ```
