class Event(_receiver.Receiver[None]):
    """A receiver that can be made ready directly.

    # Usage

    There are cases where it is useful to be able to send a signal to
    a [`select()`][frequenz.channels.select] loop, for example, to stop a loop from
    outside the loop itself.

    To do that, you can use an [`Event`][frequenz.channels.event.Event] receiver and
    call [`set()`][frequenz.channels.event.Event.set] on it when you want to make it
    ready.

    # Stopping

    The receiver will be re-activated (will keep blocking) after the current set
    event is received. To stop the receiver completely, you can call
    [`stop()`][frequenz.channels.event.Event.stop].

    # Example

    Example: Exit after printing the first 5 numbers
        ```python
        import asyncio

        from frequenz.channels import Anycast, select, selected_from
        from frequenz.channels.event import Event

        channel: Anycast[int] = Anycast(name="channel")
        receiver = channel.new_receiver()
        sender = channel.new_sender()
        stop_event = Event(name="stop")

                elif selected_from(selected, stop_event):
                    print("Stop event triggered")
