    # Usage

    A [`FileWatcher`][frequenz.channels.file_watcher.FileWatcher] receiver can be used
    to watch for changes in a set of files. It will generate an
    [`Event`][frequenz.channels.file_watcher.Event] message every time a file is
    created, modified or deleted, depending on the type of events that it is configured
    to watch for.

    The [event][frequenz.channels.file_watcher.EventType] message contains the
    [`type`][frequenz.channels.file_watcher.Event.type] of change that was observed and
    the [`path`][frequenz.channels.file_watcher.Event.path] where the change was
    observed.

    # Event Types

    The following event types are available:

    * [`CREATE`][frequenz.channels.file_watcher.EventType.CREATE]:
        {{docstring_summary("frequenz.channels.file_watcher.EventType.CREATE")}}
    * [`MODIFY`][frequenz.channels.file_watcher.EventType.MODIFY]:
        {{docstring_summary("frequenz.channels.file_watcher.EventType.MODIFY")}}
    * [`DELETE`][frequenz.channels.file_watcher.EventType.DELETE]:
        {{docstring_summary("frequenz.channels.file_watcher.EventType.DELETE")}}
