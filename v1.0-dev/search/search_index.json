A message may be sent over a channel, and another process or thread is able to receive messages sent over a channel it has a reference to, as a stream. Different implementations of channels may be buffered or not, and either synchronous or asynchronous.</p> <p>Frequenz Channels are mostly designed after Go channels but it also borrows ideas from Rust channels.</p>"},{"location":"#installation","title":"Installation","text":"<p>First, you need to make sure you have Python installed (at least version 3.11):</p> <pre><code>$ python3 --version\nPython 3.11.4\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>These instructions assume you are using a POSIX compatible <code>sh</code> shell.</p> <p>If that command doesn't print a version newer than 3.11.0, you'll need to download and install Python first.</p> <p>To install Frequenz Channels, you probably want to create a new virtual environment first:</p> <pre><code>mkdir my-channels-project\ncd my-channels-project\npython3 -m venv .venv\n. .venv/bin/activate\n</code></pre> <p>Tip</p> <p>Using <code>direnv</code> can greatly simplify this process as it automates the creation, activation, and deactivation of the virtual environment.

A call to\n    [`reset()`][frequenz.channels.util.Timer.reset],\n    [`ready()`][frequenz.channels.util.Timer.ready],\n    [`receive()`][frequenz.channels.util.Timer.receive] or the async iterator interface\n    to await for a new message will start the timer.\n\n    Example: Periodic timer example\n        ```python\n        async for drift in Timer.periodic(timedelta(seconds=1.0)):\n            print(f\"The timer has triggered {drift=}\")\n        ```\n\n        But you can also use a [`select`][frequenz.channels.util.select] to combine\n        it with other receivers, and even start it (semi) manually:\n\n        ```python\n        import logging\n        from frequenz.channels.util import select, selected_from\n        from frequenz.channels import Broadcast\n\n        timer = Timer.timeout(timedelta(seconds=1.0), auto_start=False)\n        chan = Broadcast[int](\"input-chan\")\n        battery_data = chan.new_receiver()\n\n        timer = Timer.timeout(timedelta(seconds=1.0), auto_start=False)\n        # Do some other initialization, the timer will start automatically if\n        # a message is awaited (or manually via `reset()`).\n        async for selected in select(battery_data, timer):\n            if selected_from(selected, battery_data):\n                if selected.was_closed():\n                    logging.warning(\"battery channel closed\")\n                    continue\n                battery_soc = selected.value\n            elif selected_from(selected, timer):\n                # Print some regular battery data\n                print(f\"Battery is charged at {battery_soc}%\")\n        ```\n\n    Example: Timeout example\n        ```python\n        import logging\n        from frequenz.channels.util import select, selected_from\n        from frequenz.channels import Broadcast\n\n        def process_data(data: int):\n            logging.info(\"Processing data: %d\", data)\n\n        def do_heavy_processing(data: int):\n            logging.info(\"Heavy processing data: %d\", data)\n\n        timer = Timer.timeout(timedelta(seconds=1.0), auto_start=False)\n        chan1 = Broadcast[int](\"input-chan-1\")\n        chan2 = Broadcast[int](\"input-chan-2\")\n        battery_data = chan1.new_receiver()\n        heavy_process = chan2.new_receiver()\n        async for selected in select(battery_data, heavy_process, timer):\n            if selected_from(selected, battery_data):\n                if selected.was_closed():\n                    logging.warning(\"battery channel closed\")\n                    continue\n                process_data(selected.value)\n                timer.reset()\n            elif selected_from(selected, heavy_process):\n                if selected.was_closed():\n                    logging.warning(\"processing channel closed\")\n                    continue\n                do_heavy_processing(selected.value)\n            elif selected_from(selected, timer):\n                logging.warning(\"No data received in time\")\n        ```\n\n        In this case `do_heavy_processing` might take 2 seconds, and we don't\n        want our timeout timer to trigger for the missed ticks, and want the\n        next tick to be relative to the time timer was last triggered.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        interval: timedelta,\n        missed_tick_policy: MissedTickPolicy,\n        /,\n        *,\n        auto_start: bool = True,\n        start_delay: timedelta = timedelta(0),\n        loop: asyncio.AbstractEventLoop | None = None,\n    ) -&gt; None:\n        \"\"\"Create an instance.\n\n        See the class documentation for details.\n\n        Args:\n            interval: The time between timer ticks.

You can also quickly check if the receiver was\n                # stopped and let any other unexpected exceptions bubble up.\n                if selected.was_stopped:\n                    print(\"timer1 was stopped\")\n                    continue\n                print(f\"timer1: now={datetime.datetime.now()} drift={selected.value}\")\n                timer2.stop()\n            elif selected_from(selected, timer2):\n                # Explicitly handling of exceptions\n                match selected.exception:\n                    case ReceiverStoppedError():\n                        print(\"timer2 was stopped\")\n                    case Exception() as exception:\n                        print(f\"timer2: exception={exception}\")\n                    case None:\n                        # All good, no exception, we can use `selected.value` safely\n                        print(\n                            f\"timer2: now={datetime.datetime.now()} drift={selected.value}\"\n                        )\n                    case _ as unhanded:\n                        assert_never(unhanded)\n            else:\n                # This is not necessary, as select() will check for exhaustiveness, but\n                # it is good practice to have it in case you forgot to handle a new\n                # receiver added to `select()` at a later point in time.\n                assert False\n        ```\n\n    Args:\n        *receivers: The receivers to select from.\n\n    Yields:\n        The currently selected item.\n\n    Raises:\n        UnhandledSelectedError: If a selected receiver was not handled in the if-chain.\n        SelectErrorGroup: If there is an error while finishing the select operation and\n            receivers fail while cleaning up.\n        SelectError: If there is an error while selecting receivers during normal\n            operation.  For example if a receiver raises an exception in the `ready()`\n            method.  Normal errors while receiving values are not raised, but reported\n            via the `Selected` instance.\n    \"\"\"\n    receivers_map: dict[str, Receiver[Any]] = {str(hash(r)): r for r in receivers}\n    pending: set[asyncio.Task[bool]] = set()\n\n    try:\n        for name, recv in receivers_map.items():\n            pending.add(asyncio.create_task(recv.ready(), name=name))\n\n        while pending:\n            done, pending = await asyncio.wait(\n                pending, return_when=asyncio.FIRST_COMPLETED\n            )\n\n            for task in done:\n                receiver_active: bool = True\n                name = task.get_name()\n                recv = receivers_map[name]\n                if exception := task.exception():\n                    match exception:\n                        case asyncio.CancelledError():\n                            # If the receiver was cancelled, then it means we want to\n                            # exit the select loop, so we handle the receiver but we\n                            # don't add it back to the pending list.\n                            receiver_active = False\n                        case _ as exc:\n                            raise SelectError(f\"Error while selecting {recv}\") from exc\n\n                selected = Selected(recv)\n                yield selected\n                if not selected._handled:  # pylint: disable=protected-access\n                    raise UnhandledSelectedError(selected)\n\n                receiver_active = task.result()\n                if not receiver_active:\n                    continue\n\n                # Add back the receiver to the pending list\n                name = task.get_name()\n                recv = receivers_map[name]\n                pending.add(asyncio.create_task(recv.ready(), name=name))\n    finally:\n        await _stop_pending_tasks(pending)\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"reference/frequenz/channels/util/#frequenz.channels.util.selected_from","title":"frequenz.channels.util.selected_from","text":"<pre><code>selected_from(\n    selected: Selected[Any], receiver: Receiver[_T]\n) -&gt; TypeGuard[Selected[_T]]\n</code></pre> <p>Check if the given receiver was selected by <code>select()</code>.</p> <p>This function is used in conjunction with the <code>Selected</code> class to determine which receiver was selected in <code>select()</code> iteration.</p> <p>It also works as a type guard to narrow the type of the <code>Selected</code> instance to the type of the receiver.</p> <p>Please see <code>select()</code> for an example.</p> PARAMETER  DESCRIPTION <code>selected</code> <p>The result of a <code>select()</code> iteration.</p> <p> TYPE: <code>Selected[Any]</code> </p> <code>receiver</code> <p>The receiver to check if it was the source of a select operation.</p> <p> TYPE: <code>Receiver[_T]</code> </p> RETURNS DESCRIPTION <code>TypeGuard[Selected[_T]]</code> <p>Whether the given receiver was selected.</p> Source code in <code>frequenz/channels/util/_select.py</code> <pre><code>def selected_from(\n    selected: Selected[Any], receiver: Receiver[_T]\n) -&gt; TypeGuard[Selected[_T]]:\n    \"\"\"Check if the given receiver was selected by [`select()`][frequenz.channels.util.select].\n\n    This function is used in conjunction with the\n    [`Selected`][frequenz.channels.util.Selected] class to determine which receiver was\n    selected in `select()` iteration.\n\n    It also works as a [type guard][typing.TypeGuard] to narrow the type of the\n    `Selected` instance to the type of the receiver.\n\n    Please see [`select()`][frequenz.channels.util.select] for an example.\n\n    Args:\n        selected: The result of a `select()` iteration.\n        receiver: The receiver to check if it was the source of a select operation.\n\n    Returns:\n        Whether the given receiver was selected.\n    \"\"\"\n    if handled := selected._recv is receiver:  # pylint: disable=protected-access\n        selected._handled = True  # pylint: disable=protected-access\n    return handled\n</code></pre>"}]}
